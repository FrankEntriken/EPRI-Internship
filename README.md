# EPRI-Internship

This repository highlights my work during my internship at the Electrical Power Research Institute (EPRI) over the summer of 2018. I was a part of the Energy Storage Team and helped connect their existing application, StorageVET, to the OpenEI Utility Rate Database, a website that is up to date with all existing energy tariffs in the United States. My goal was to allow the user to narrow down and select the appropriate energy rate that they were being charged as a consumer by using the API available from OpenEI and to represent this tariff in a format that StorageVET can use.

## StorageVET 2.1
StorageVETÂ® 2.1 facilitates the understanding of where to place and install energy storage, the optimum size as well as controls options. StorageVET 2.1 implements dispatch optimization with sensitivity analysis to assist in planning energy storage project development by enabling rapid analysis of scenarios with different storage sizes, costs, and value streams. Additionally, StorageVET 2.1 is valuable as a research tool to inform broad-sweeping analyses of trends in storage value as a function of location, operation, and technical capabilities.

StorageVET is a publicly available, open-source, Python-based energy storage valuation tool.
